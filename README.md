test user credentials:
username - amandawickramasekera2000@gmail.com (Sir, I'm afraid although you have told us to use NIC as username, it is not possible to use NIC as username in Firebase Auth, they allow email and some other social media logins and phone number login only, so I had no choice but using email)
password - abc123

Also Xcode didn't push the Pods folder to Github even though I tried several times. It will be added if the pod install command is typed in terminal, otherwise the app won't build.
